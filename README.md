# [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) solutions in Kotlin

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

This repository contains the (work in progress) solutions written in Kotlin by me ([@passsy](https://twitter.com/passsy)). I try to solve all days via TDD
